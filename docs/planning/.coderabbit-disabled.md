# CodeRabbit Bot - Disabled

## Status
**CodeRabbit bot integration has been removed from this repository.**

## Reason
CodeRabbit was creating more friction than value for our workflow:

- **Excessive Noise**: Automatic review comments cluttered PR discussions and made it harder to focus on human feedback and core review discussions
- **Notification Overload**: Frequent updates and re-reviews on every commit flooded maintainers and contributors with notifications
- **Confusion**: Contributors struggled to distinguish between critical feedback and automated suggestions, slowing down the merge process
- **Context Loss**: Automatic comments often lacked understanding of the project's specific architecture and design decisions

## What Was Removed
This PR removes:
- Any CodeRabbit configuration files (`.coderabbit.yml`/`.coderabbit.yaml`)
- CodeRabbit workflow references from GitHub Actions (if present)
- Documentation or badges mentioning CodeRabbit

## Going Forward
- Pull requests will no longer receive automatic CodeRabbit reviews
- The team can focus on meaningful, high-signal human code reviews
- If AI-assisted code review is needed in the future, it can be reintroduced with better scoping and opt-in mechanisms

## How to Re-enable (if needed)
If the team decides to use CodeRabbit again:
1. Visit https://github.com/apps/coderabbit
2. Configure the desired settings
3. Add `.coderabbit.yml` for repository-specific rules (optional)
