## 🚀 About the Project

**AstraGuard AI** is an open-source security-focused system that seamlessly combines **AI-assisted threat detection** with **practical offensive security tooling**.

We bridge the gap between theoretical security concepts and real-world workflows, making it the perfect platform for students, developers, and early security practitioners to:
- 🛡️ **Test** applications against simulated threats.
- 📊 **Analyze** risks with structured data.
- 🧠 **Understand** vulnerabilities through automated reporting.
- 🎓 **Learn** by bridging theory and real security workflows without unnecessary complexity.

The core engine drives the security operations, while our intelligent AI layer handles attack surface analysis, smart payload generation, and guided exploitation (in safe, controlled environments).

**Target Audience**: Primarily learners and early-stage practitioners who want hands-on experience with modern security workflows.

### Modular Architecture


AstraGuard AI is built on a **dual-engine architecture** that separates the heavy lifting of security operations from the intelligence of decision-making.

### 1. 🛡️ Core Security Engine (The Muscle)
*Written in Python*
- **Role**: Executes concrete security tasks.
- **Capabilities**:
    - Packet manipulation (Scapy)
    - Network scanning (Nmap integration)
    - Payload delivery
    - Traffic interception (Burp Suite / Proxy integration)
- **Design**: stateless, robust, and failsafe. It does exactly what it's told, safely.

### 2. 🧠 AI Intelligence Layer (The Brain)
*Written in Python (LangChain/Ollama) & Node.js*
- **Role**: Analyzes context and makes decisions.
- **Capabilities**:
    - **Attack Surface Analysis**: Reads scan data to identify "interesting" targets.
    - **Smart Payload Generation**: Crafts payloads specific to the target stack (e.g., "This looks like an older MongoDB, try these NoSQL injections").
    - **Risk Assessment**: Scores vulnerabilities based on real-world exploitability, not just CVSS.
- **Privacy**: Runs **100% locally** using Ollama (Llama 3 / Mistral), ensuring sensitive scan data never leaves your machine.
